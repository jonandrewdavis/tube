# Tube


A lightweight Godot addon that helps create simple multiplayer sessions.

One player creates a session and shares the session ID with others through an external channel (WhatsApp, Discord, etc.). The other players can then join and play together. That’s it, no server deployment needed.

## Use case & limitations

Tube works on any platform that supports WebRTC over the internet, see [Requirements](#requirements).
It also runs on non-web platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS) over a local network, without needing an internet connection.

However, the benefit of not having to deploy a server comes with a trade-off: in some cases, two peers may fail to connect. To better understand why this happens, see [How it works](#how-it-works).

Because no server is deployed by default, Tube may not be suitable for projects that require high stability or support for a large user base. If stability is critical, you can deploy your own servers to ensure reliable connectivity [Using your own servers](#using-your-own-servers).
As it is, Tube is a great option for:
- Rapid prototyping of peer-to-peer multiplayer
- Testing multiplayer games
- Learning Godot High-level multiplayer
- Local multiplayer game
- Game demo
- Simple indie game
- Private multiplayer game

There’s no strict technical limit on the number of players in a session, but each additional player increases the load on the server peer.

Tube was developed and tested with Godot 4.5, and it may also work with other Godot 4.x versions. It is not compatible with Godot 3.

## How to use

### Requirements

**Tube** uses WebRTC, it works automatically on HTML5 exports, but requires an external GDExtension plugin on other platforms. You can find everything you need in the [webrtc-native plugin repository](https://github.com/godotengine/webrtc-native/releases).
> [!NOTE]
> If the WebRTC implementation is missing on Desktop platforms, `create_session` will fail with `error_raised`, and `TubeClient.is_webrtc_available()` returns `false`.

When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the `INTERNET` and `CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE` permission in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by Android.

To use this add-on effectively, it is essential to understand [Godot High-Level Multiplayer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html)

### Installation

To install copy the *addons/tube* folder into *addons* Godot project's *addons* folder.
Or download it directly from the [Godot Asset Store](https://store.godotengine.org/asset/androodev/tube/) (for 4.6 and below get it from the [Godot asset library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/4419)).

Verify that the addon is enabled in your Godot project in `Project Settings -> Plugins`.

### Configuration & Utilisation

**Tube** is composed of two main elements:
- `TubeContext`: A `Resource` defining the configuration for establishing session connections.
- `TubeClient`: A `Node` managing network connection and multiplayer peers.

#### 1. Creating a `TubeContext`

First, create a new `TubeContext` for your project `in Godot FileSystem inspector -> Create New -> Resource... -> TubeContext`. And do the following :
1. Enter an `App ID` in your `TubeContext`. App ID must be exactly 15 ASCII characters. You can generate one automatically by clicking `Generate App ID`. App ID must be the same on all instance of your game.

2. Add `Trackers URLs`, you can use any or all of the following:
   - wss://tracker.androodev.com
   - wss://tracker.openwebtorrent.com
   - wss://tracker.files.fm:7073/announce
   - wss://tracker.btorrent.xyz/
   - wss://tracker.ghostchu-services.top:443/announce

3. Add `Stun Servers URLs`, you can use the following:
   - stun:stun.l.google.com:19302
   - stun:stun.cloudflare.com:3478

4. Optionally, add fallback `Turn Servers`:
   - See [AndrooDev's TURN server](#androodev's-turn-server)

#### 2. Adding a `TubeClient` to Your Scene

Next add a `TubeClient` to our game scene : `in Godot Scene Dock -> Add Child Node -> TubeClient`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `TubeClient` must be present in the SceneTree to function, and it can be placed anywhere.
However, it should not be removed while a session is open (either, creating, joining, created or joined).

Assign the previously created TubeContext to the Context property of your TubeClient.
Optionally, you can also configure:
- `peer_signaling_timeout`
- `peer_signaling_max_attempts`
- `multiplayer_root_node`

For more details about the available properties and functions:
- In Godot Scene Dock -> Right-click on your `TubeClient` -> `Open Documentation`.
- In the Script tab, search for `TubeClient` in the Help panel.


#### 3. Creating and Joining Sessions

On only one instance of the game call `create_session()`, for example:
```GDScript
@onready var label: Label = $Label # Label to display session id
@onready var tube_client: TubeClient = $TubeClient # reference to tube client in scene tree


func _on_button_pressed(): # User press create session button
    tube_client.create_session()
    label.text = tube_client.session_id
```
This player becomes the server (`is_server = true`) and can access the created session ID in the `session_id` property.

The server player should share this session ID with others through an external channel (e.g. Discord).
Other players can join by calling `join_session(session_id)`, for example:
```GDScript
@onready var line_edit: LineEdit = $LineEdit # text user input for session id

func _on_button_pressed(): # User press join session button
    tube_client.join_session(line_edit.text)
```

When the session is successfully created or joined, the corresponding signals are emitted:
- `session_created`
- `session_joined`

If an error occurs during creation or joining, the client emits:
`error_raised(code: SessionError, message: String)`
(see the `TubeClient` documentation in Godot for details on signals and error codes).

Any player can leave the session by calling `leave_session()`.
If the server calls it, the session will close for everyone, and `session_left` will be emitted.

The server can:
- Kick a player using `kick_peer(p_peer_id: int)`
- Refuse new connections automatically by setting `refuse_new_connections = true`


#### 4. Implementing Multiplayer Logic

By default, `TubeClient` automatically configures Godot’s `MultiplayerAPI` and `MultiplayerPeer` on the SceneTree root node.
You can customize this behavior by setting the multiplayer_root_node property on TubeClient (see [SceneTree.set_multiplayer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_scenetree.html#class-scenetree-method-set-multiplayer) for more information).

Once peers are connected, use [Godot High-level multiplayer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html) to implement your game logic.
You can make use of tools such as:
- [Godot RPC](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html#remote-procedure-calls)
- [MultiplayerSpawner](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/)
- [MultiplayerSynchronizer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_multiplayersynchronizer.html)

For example:
```GDScript
func _on_some_input(): # Connected to some input.
    transfer_some_input.rpc_id(1) # Send the input only to the server.


# Call local is required if the server is also a player.
@rpc("any_peer", "call_local", "reliable")
func transfer_some_input():
    # The server knows who sent the input.
    var sender_id = multiplayer.get_remote_sender_id()
    # Process the input and affect game logic.
```

To know more about how to configure and use it, you can watch [AndrooDev's Friendslop Co-Op Tutorial Part 2: Peer to Peer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgIqB6JNcro)

### Troubleshooting

**Tube** includes a helpful tool called `TubeInspector` for debugging and visualizing internal network activity.  
To use it, add the scene located at `/addons/tube/tube_inspector.tscn` to your project and assign your `TubeClient` to it.

> [!NOTE]
> Some features, such as latency display and chat, are only available if `TubeInspector` is part of the `MultiplayerAPI` SceneTree.

#### Major known issues

The most common reason a player cannot connect is a **symmetric NAT**.  
A symmetric NAT is a router configuration that prevents NAT hole punching. This means that if both peers are behind a symmetric NAT, the connection will likely fail.

You can check whether you are behind a symmetric NAT using the **NAT hole punching** field in `TubeInspector`. Multiple STUN servers with different addresses are required. If the result is `unknown`, try different STUN domains. This tool is not available on Web platform. You can also test here: [Symmetric NAT test](https://tomchen.github.io/symmetric-nat-test/), but note that false positives are common due to browser privacy behavior.

If **NAT hole punching** shows `likely to fail` for two players, then a direct Internet connection is likely impossible without a relay server. You can easily add a TURN server.  See: [Using your own servers](#using-your-own-servers).

#### Minor known issues

> [!CAUTION]
> Invalid status code. Got 'XXX', expected 101.

This refers to an [HTTP status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#server_error_responses), indicating that a tracker is unavailable or encountered an issue. `TubeInspector` will show which trackers failed to connect.
This problem is related to tracker availability or network conditions. There is no reliable way to handle this error in GDScript. Because public trackers can occasionally be unstable, we recommend using **multiple trackers** to improve connection reliability.

## How it works

**Tube** establishes a server–client architecture between peers.
One peer acts as the server, while all other peers connect to it as clients.
The server is responsible for relaying Godot’s RPC (see [Godot High-level multiplayer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html)) between peers.

To connect peers to the server, Tube uses WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication), an open-source technology that enables secure, real-time peer-to-peer data transmission.
Establishing a WebRTC connection requires an initial signaling phase, which depends on three external components:
- Signaling servers: Used to exchange connection initialization messages between peers.
- STUN servers: Help peers determine their public address and how they can be reached.
- TURN servers (optional): Act as relays when a direct peer-to-peer connection cannot be established.

For more details on WebRTC, visit the [Official WebRTC web site](https://webrtc.org) and the [WebRTC Godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_webrtcpeerconnection.html)

### Local signaling

On a local network, the server peer listens on determined port. When joining, other peers broadcast their signaling data across the network at destination of the server. Once signaling is complete, peers automatically switch to a WebRTC connection.

STUN and TURN servers are not needed in this mode.

Because the Web platform cannot open listening ports, local signaling is unavailable on Web builds.

### Online signaling

For Signaling servers, **Tube** use WebTorrent tracker servers as signaling servers. Several public trackers are available, such as those listed in [Configuration & Utilisation](#configuration--utilisation).

It is recommended to use multiple trackers to improve connection reliability, as public trackers can occasionally be unstable.

AndrooDev hosts a compatible public tracker at: `wss://tracker.androodev.com`.

To learn more about BitTorrent trackers and WebTorrent, see the [WebTorrent GitHub](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent) and the [Wikipedia BitTorrent Tracker page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_tracker).

If you need more stable connections for your game, you can deploy your own tracker servers, see [Using your own servers](#using-your-own-servers).

Many public STUN servers are available, such as those provided by Google.
You can find an updated list here: [Public STUN list](https://gist.github.com/mondain/b0ec1cf5f60ae726202e)

Currently, there are no reliable public TURN servers.
Without a TURN server, there is no fallback mechanism when peers cannot establish a direct connection, for example, if both peers are behind a *symmetric NAT*.

For maximum reliability, you can deploy your own TURN server and add it to your `TubeContext` configuration see [Using your own servers](#using-your-own-servers).

## Using your own servers

### WebTorrent tracker
You can deploy your own WebTorrent tracker using the [Official WebTorrent Tracker](https://github.com/webtorrent/bittorrent-tracker) or the [OpenWebTorrent Tracker](https://github.com/OpenWebTorrent/openwebtorrent-tracker).

Make sure to configure it with WebSocket support, available on Internet and set its URL in your TubeContext.

It is strongly recommended to use secure WebSockets (WSS/TLS) for to ensure reliable and encrypted communication and some browser will block non-secure communication.

Host your own TypeScript port on a Cloudflare worker via: https://github.com/jonandrewdavis/ws-tracker-server

### TURN server

Some restrictive connections like universities or VPNs will not connect. A relay can help. TURN is a way to relay traffic. you can host your own TURN server using [coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) or [eturnal](https://github.com/processone/eturnal). They can also be used as STUN servers.

Once deployed, add your TURN server’s URL and credentials to your `TubeContext`.

For security reasons, it’s recommended to use ephemeral credentials to prevent unauthorized access to your TURN server.
This approach requires additional setup, such as generating credentials dynamically through a secure backend.

There are also third-party TURN hosting services available, but most are paid solutions.


## AndrooDev's TURN server

AndrooDev provides a free TURN server at: https://api.androodev.com/turn using Cloudflare RealTime. You can also sign up and host one yourself. See [this PR](https://github.com/jonandrewdavis/AndrooDev-Friendslop-Co-Op-Tutorial-Part-2/pull/2) for a full example. Sample below:

```GDScript
func _on_request_completed(_result, _response_code, _headers, body):
	var response: Dictionary = JSON.parse_string(body.get_string_from_utf8())

	if response and response.has("iceServers"):
		temp_ice = response["iceServers"][1]
		tube_client.context.turn_servers.append(temp_ice)
		prints("DEBUG", tube_client.context.turn_servers)

func set_turn_enabled(is_enabled: bool):
	if is_enabled and temp_ice:
		tube_client.context.turn_servers.append(temp_ice)
	elif is_enabled:
		new_http_client.request("https://api.androodev.com/turn")
	else:
		tube_client.context.turn_servers = []
```
